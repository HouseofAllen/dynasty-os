# The Alchemical Methodology

This document outlines the dynamic processes for knowledge management, review, and synthesis. It is the practical guide to how we think, learn, and evolve.

## Core Components

-   **The Royal Chronicler (The Historian):** A nightly sub-agent that records the *explicit*. It reviews session transcripts for stated decisions, new rules, and project updates, then surgically updates the core `Areas` and `Projects` files. Its purpose is to maintain an accurate, factual record of official history.
-   **The Alchemist (The Synthesizer):** A weekly sub-agent that seeks the *implicit*. It reads across all daily `memory/` logs and transcripts, looking for recurring questions, subtle patterns, and conceptual connections that are not explicitly stated. Its purpose is to discover emergent, non-obvious insights. It does not edit core files; it produces new, standalone "Insight Notes" in the `Archives/Insights/` directory.

## Review Cadences & Processes

### Daily Cycle (Automated)

-   **04:00 CST (Nightly):** The Royal Chronicler runs, committing the previous day's official history to the archives.

### Weekly Cycle

-   **Sunday, 18:00 CST (Automated):** The Alchemist runs, performing its synthesis and generating Insight Notes for the week.
-   **Sunday, 19:00 CST (Manual/Agent-led):** I will perform a **Weekly Review**.
    1.  Read `Areas/Objectives.md` to re-center on the quarterly mission.
    2.  Review the status of all active projects in the `Projects/` directory.
    3.  Review the titles of all new Insight Notes generated by the Alchemist.
    4.  Present a concise "Weekly Review Summary" to the King, highlighting progress against objectives and noting any particularly interesting insights that may warrant manual review.

### Monthly Cycle

-   **Last Sunday of the Month (Manual/Agent-led):** I will perform a **Monthly Review**.
    1.  Read through all of the Alchemist's Insight Notes from the past month.
    2.  Identify broader themes and actionable intelligence.
    3.  Propose updates to our core knowledge files (`Areas/` or `Resources/`) based on these synthesized insights.
    4.  Present a "Monthly Synthesis Report" to the King.

### Quarterly Cycle

-   **Last Sunday of the Quarter (Collaborative):** We will perform the **Quarterly Review & Planning Session**.
    1.  Review and grade the success of the past quarter's mission and key results.
    2.  Archive the old `Objectives.md` section.
    3.  Collaboratively define the mission and key results for the upcoming quarter.
